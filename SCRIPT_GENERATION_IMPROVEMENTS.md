# Script Generation Improvements

## Problem Identified

The AI was generating **generic, vague content** instead of specific, actionable scripts.

### ❌ BEFORE (Bad Output):
```
"Hello and welcome! Today we're going to explore an important topic that was recently 
discussed on REDDIT.

A member from r/Entrepreneur shared their experience: [quote from post]

This resonates with many people facing similar challenges. Let me break down what's 
really going on here and what you can do about it.

First, it's important to understand the context...

Second, let's talk about practical solutions...

Start by identifying the core challenge. What's the real problem here? Once you 
understand that, you can begin to address it systematically.

Next, look for patterns in your own situation. Does this apply to you?

Finally, take action. Knowledge without action doesn't create change."
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Generic fluff ("let me break this down", "start by identifying")
- ❌ No specific solutions (just says "take action")
- ❌ Doesn't address the actual problem (scaling spending)
- ❌ Sounds like instructions to make content, not actual content

---

### ✅ AFTER (Good Output):
```
"Your digital agency just grew from 3 to 12 employees and spending is spiraling out of 
control. You're not alone—78% of agencies fail at this exact stage due to cash flow 
mismanagement.

Here's what's actually happening: Your revenue grew 4x but your costs grew 7x. 
Employee salaries, contractor fees, software subscriptions, and office expenses are 
eating your profits.

The Fix - 5 Actions to Take This Week:

1. IMPLEMENT THE RULE OF 40
   Right now, your employee costs are probably 60-70% of revenue. Industry standard 
   is 40%. Calculate: (Total Employee Costs / Monthly Revenue) × 100
   Target: Get this under 45% in 90 days.

2. SWITCH TO WEEKLY BUDGET REVIEWS
   Stop doing monthly reviews. By the time you notice overspending, you're $10K deep.
   Every Monday at 9am, review last week's spending. Use Finmark or Runway for 
   real-time tracking.

3. CUT CONTRACTOR COSTS BY 30%
   You're probably paying 3 part-time contractors $5K/month each = $15K
   Hire 1 full-time developer at $8K/month instead. Save $7K monthly = $84K yearly.

4. AUDIT YOUR SOFTWARE STACK
   Most agencies waste $2-3K/month on unused subscriptions.
   Cancel anything you haven't used in 30 days. Use Spendesk to track this.

5. IMPLEMENT PROFIT FIRST METHOD
   Before paying ANY bills, transfer 5% of revenue to a profit account.
   This forces you to operate on 95% of revenue, naturally controlling spending.

Real Example: My agency hit the same wall at 10 employees. We were spending $45K/month 
with $40K revenue. These 5 changes got us to $55K revenue with $35K spending in 4 months.

Your action for TODAY: Calculate your Rule of 40 number right now. If it's over 50%, 
you're in the danger zone."
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Addresses the EXACT problem (agency scaling from 3 to 12 employees)
- ✅ Specific numbers and frameworks (Rule of 40, Profit First)
- ✅ Concrete tools (Finmark, Runway, Spendesk)
- ✅ Real examples ($5K contractors → $8K full-time = $7K saved)
- ✅ Immediate action (calculate Rule of 40 TODAY)

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt
**Added:**
- Clear distinction between BAD and GOOD examples
- Specific rules about avoiding generic phrases
- Directive to extract EXACT insights from posts
- Focus on concrete numbers, tools, frameworks

### 2. Improved Category Instructions

**Pain Points:**
- Now requires SPECIFIC problem identification
- Demands 3-5 CONCRETE solutions with exact steps
- Must include real tools/frameworks
- Focuses on immediate TODAY actions

**Trending Ideas:**
- Must state SPECIFIC trend
- Requires unique angle + recent stats
- Demands 3-5 ways to capitalize NOW
- Must include bold, shareable statements

**Content Ideas:**
- Must answer SPECIFIC questions

### 4. Increased Token Limits
Allows for more detailed, specific content:
- **Video:** 1000/1500/2200 tokens (was 800/1200/1800)
- **Blog:** 800/1300/2000 tokens (was 600/1000/1500)

- **Email:** 400/700/1000 tokens (was 300/500/700)

### 5. Adjusted Temperature
More creative while maintaining quality:
- **Professional:** 0.4 (was 0.3)
- **Casual:** 0.7 (was 0.6)

## Expected Improvements

### Before vs After Examples:

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Specificity** | "manage your budget" | "Use Finmark for weekly budget reviews every Monday at 9am" |
| **Numbers** | "save money" | "Cut $7K/month by hiring 1 full-time dev instead of 3 contractors" |
| **Frameworks** | "organize your finances" | "Implement Profit First: allocate 5% to profit account before expenses" |
| **Tools** | "use software" | "Use Runway for real-time cash tracking, Spendesk for subscriptions" |
| **Examples** | generic | "My agency saved $84K/year using these methods" |
| **Action** | "take action" | "Calculate your Rule of 40 number TODAY" |

## Testing

To test the improvements:

1. **Search for:** "scaling agency spending"
2. **Generate script** from pain points
3. **Expected result:** Specific advice like:
   - Rule of 40 calculation
   - Weekly budget review schedule
   - Specific tools (Finmark, Runway, Spendesk)
   - Exact cost savings ($7K/month)

4. **Compare to old output** - Should see NO generic phrases like:
   - ❌ "start by identifying the challenge"
   - ❌ "many people struggle with this"
   - ❌ "take action today"
   - ❌ "let me break this down"
